# Trees

This code implements basic functions of a Binary Search Tree.


### Basic Tree Operations

- Constructor
- Destructor
- Insertion
- Search
- Deletion


### Traversals

- Iterative PostOrder Traversal
- Level Order Traversal
- Recursive Pre Order Traversal
- InOrder Traversal


### Recursive Counters

- Resursive method that returns height of binary tree
- Total Number of Nodes
- Total Number of Leaf Nodes


### Rearrangement Operations

- Conversion of BST into a Sorted Doubly Linked List


### Balance

- Rotate method that balances a tree rooted at some node, P
- Method that takes the root of a BST and returns a balanced BST
- Balanced Insertion
- Balanced Deletion
